- 👋 Hi, I’m @satelliteduster, you can call me Tone (Anthony if we're already acquainted)!
- 👀 I’m interested in software engineering, modding, intermediate C++, Python, HTML, CSS, Java and Godot coding.
- 🌱 I’m currently studying computer science at Fordham Univerity (first-year grad student as of Mar 2025).
- 💞️ I’m not looking to collaborate on anything in particular, but that might change someday.
- 📫 How to reach me...I'm rather private actually. If I don't reach out first, it's nothing personal, trust me.
